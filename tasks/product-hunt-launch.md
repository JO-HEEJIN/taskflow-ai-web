## 📝 First Comment (Maker's Story)

**Post this immediately after launching:**

Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I'm the maker of TaskFlow AI, and I built this out of personal frustration.

**The Problem:**
I have ADHD. I'd see a task like "prepare for product launch" and my brain would just... freeze. Too big. Too vague. Can't start.

Traditional todo apps didn't help—they just stared at me with empty checkboxes, waiting for me to magically break down the task myself. But task breakdown IS the hard part!

**The ADHD Tax:**
Every app I tried had the same flow:
1. See the landing page
2. "Sign up to continue"
3. Brain says "maybe later"
4. Close tab
5. Never come back

Friction is the action killer for ADHD brains. We need zero resistance.

**The Solution:**
TaskFlow AI does TWO things specifically for ADHD minds:

1️⃣ **No signup wall** - Start using it RIGHT NOW. Your tasks save locally. Sign in later only if you want cross-device sync.

2️⃣ **AI Breakdown** - Click one button and GPT-4 breaks your overwhelming task into bite-sized steps. Each step is small enough that your brain doesn't panic.

**What makes it different:**
- Guest mode with full functionality (including AI!)
- Kanban board designed for visual thinkers
- Markdown support for detailed notes
- Cosmic theme (because ADHD brains like shiny things 😄)
- Progress tracking that actually motivates

**Tech Stack:**
- Frontend: Next.js 14, TypeScript, Zustand
- Backend: Node.js, Express, Azure Cosmos DB
- AI: Azure OpenAI (GPT-4)
- Hosting: Azure Container Apps

**What's Next:**
- Mobile app (PWA first, then native)
- Pomodoro timer integration
- Task templates for common ADHD struggles
- Voice input (because typing is sometimes too much)

**I'd love your feedback on:**
- What other ADHD-specific features would help?
- Is the guest mode experience smooth enough?
- Should I add more AI features (time estimation, priority suggestions)?

Try it with no friction: https://taskflow-frontend.bravesky-cb93d4eb.eastus.azurecontainerapps.io

Thanks for checking it out! 🚀

🚀 Launching TaskFlow AI on @ProductHunt today!

For everyone with ADHD who's ever stared at "build website" and thought "...but HOW?"

AI breaks it down. No signup needed. Zero friction.

ADHD brains freeze at big tasks.

Todo apps say "just break it down yourself"

But that's the HARD part!

TaskFlow AI does it for you with one click.

Every app I tried had a signup wall.

For ADHD brains, that's game over.

"Sign up to continue" = "Close tab and forget forever"

TaskFlow starts instantly. Sign in later if you want.

**Tweet 4:**
Demo: Watch "Build marketing website" become 8 manageable steps

Each step is small enough to actually START.

## 💬 Pre-written Responses to Common Questions

**Q: "Is this free?"**
A: Yes! Guest mode is completely free with full AI features. Sign in with Google to sync across devices (also free, powered by Azure credits).

**Q: "How does guest mode work?"**
A: Your tasks save in your browser's localStorage. No backend needed until you want to sync across devices. When you sign in, everything migrates automatically.

**Q: "What AI model do you use?"**
A: GPT-4 via Azure OpenAI. It's specifically prompted to break down tasks into ADHD-friendly bite-sized steps.

**Q: "Why build another todo app?"**
A: Most todo apps aren't built for ADHD brains. We need: (1) zero friction to start, (2) help breaking down tasks, (3) visual progress tracking. TaskFlow does all three.

**Q: "Will there be a mobile app?"**
A: It's fully responsive now (works great on mobile browsers). Native app is planned after validating product-market fit!

**Q: "How do you make money?"**
A: Currently running on Azure credits. Future plan: freemium model with premium features (templates, advanced AI, team collaboration) while keeping core features free.

**Q: "Is my data secure?"**
A: Guest data stays in your browser. Authenticated data is stored in Azure Cosmos DB with encryption at rest. No data is sold or shared.
