## 💬 Pre-Written Responses to Common Questions

**Q: "Is this free?"**
A: "Yes! Guest mode is completely free with full AI features. Sign in with Google to sync across devices (also free, powered by Azure credits)."

**Q: "How does guest mode work?"**
A: "Your tasks save in your browser's localStorage. No backend needed until you want to sync across devices. When you sign in, everything migrates automatically."

**Q: "What AI model do you use?"**
A: "GPT-4 via Azure OpenAI. It's specifically prompted to break down tasks into ADHD-friendly bite-sized steps."

**Q: "Why build another todo app?"**
A: "Most todo apps aren't built for ADHD brains. We need: (1) zero friction to start, (2) help breaking down tasks, (3) visual progress tracking. TaskFlow does all three."

**Q: "Will there be a mobile app?"**
A: "It's fully responsive now (works great on mobile browsers). Native app is planned after validating product-market fit!"

**Q: "How do you make money?"**
A: "Currently running on Azure credits. Future plan: freemium model with premium features (templates, advanced AI, team collaboration) while keeping core features free."

**Q: "Is my data secure?"**
A: "Guest data stays in your browser. Authenticated data is stored in Azure Cosmos DB with encryption at rest. No data is sold or shared."
