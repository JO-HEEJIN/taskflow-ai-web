- Or: Purple/blue gradient text matching app theme
- Background: Semi-transparent black box behind text (optional)

**Size:**
- Large enough to read on mobile (test at 480p)
- 72-96pt font size minimum

**Position:**
- Top third or bottom third of screen (avoid center where action happens)
- Consistent position throughout video

**Animation:**
- Fade in (0.3s)
- Stay on screen (as per timestamps above)
- Fade out (0.3s)
- OR slide in from bottom, slide out to top

---

## 🎵 Optional: Background Music

**If you choose to add music:**
- Upbeat, positive, inspiring (but not distracting)
- No vocals (voiceless instrumental only)
- Low volume (30-40% max - text overlays are primary)
- Royalty-free sources:
  - Epidemic Sound
  - Artlist
  - YouTube Audio Library (free)
  - Uppbeat (free with attribution)

**Suggested vibe:**
- Electronic/ambient
- Hopeful/uplifting
- Not too fast-paced
- 120-130 BPM

**Examples of good tracks:**
- "Inspiring Upbeat" type tracks
- "Tech & Innovation" genre
- Lo-fi beats (calming for ADHD audience)

**Note:** Music is OPTIONAL. Silent with text overlays works great too!
