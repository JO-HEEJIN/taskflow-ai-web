# PWA Icons

## Required Icons

For the PWA to work properly, you need to create the following icons:

### icon-192.png (192x192)
- Size: 192x192 pixels
- Format: PNG
- Purpose: App icon for Android home screen, notification icon
- Design: Should have transparent background or match theme color

### icon-512.png (512x512)
- Size: 512x512 pixels
- Format: PNG
- Purpose: High-resolution app icon for splash screen
- Design: Should have transparent background or match theme color

## Design Guidelines

1. **Simple and recognizable:** Icon should be clear at small sizes
2. **Theme colors:** Use purple (#c084fc) as primary color
3. **Maskable:** Icon should work with circular, rounded square, or squircle masks
4. **Safe zone:** Keep important content within 80% of the icon area
